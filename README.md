# 3d-print

3D printable NREC logo

## How to print

This print uses 3 colors, which means that you have to change filament
twice. In addition, for the medium and small variants which include
magnets, the print must be stopped mid-print to place the magnets. The
STL files are generated using OpenSCAD, which in turn uses SVG files
derived from the official NREC logo.
